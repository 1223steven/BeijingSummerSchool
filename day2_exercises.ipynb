For computational purposes it is desireable to be able to use large stepsizes since using a larger step size allows to simulate longer (in physical time) trajectories with the same computational budget. \n"

The first particle $q_1$ feels fhe force of a harmonic spring which is connected with the origin has a rest length of $r_1$ and stiffnes constant $k_1$. The below figure illustrates this model \n",
